### Key Points
- **Mensuration** focuses on calculating surface areas and volumes of right circular cylinders, cones, and spheres, including practical problems like cost calculations, melting/recasting, and combinations of solids (no frustum included).
- **Statistics** emphasizes measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) for raw and grouped data, along with graphical tools like histograms and ogives to find quartiles and inter-quartile range.
- **Constructions** involve precise geometric drawings, such as tangents from an external point to a circle, circumcircle/incircle for triangles, and constructions based on loci theorems.

### Mensuration Overview
This unit deals with 3D solids: right circular cylinder, right circular cone, and sphere. Students learn formulas for total surface area, curved/lateral surface area, and volume. Key applications include:
- Direct problems on cost (e.g., painting or material usage).
- Inner/outer volumes (e.g., hollow objects).
- Melting and recasting (converting one solid to another).
- Combinations of two solids (e.g., cone on cylinder).

Frustum problems are excluded.

### Statistics Overview
Core concepts include grouped/ungrouped data, class intervals, and frequency. Measures of central tendency:
- Mean (direct, assumed mean, step-deviation methods).
- Median (for raw data, grouped via formula or ogive).
- Mode (for raw data, grouped via histogram or modal class).

Graphical representation covers histograms (varying widths), frequency polygons, and less-than ogives to derive median, quartiles, mode, and inter-quartile range.

### Constructions Overview
Constructions are part of Geometry, emphasizing ruler-and-compass tasks:
- Tangents from an external point to a circle.
- Circumcircle and incircle of a triangle.
- Inscribing/circumscribing circles on regular hexagons.
- Loci-based constructions (e.g., points equidistant from fixed points/lines).

These build precision and understanding of circle properties.

### Detailed Expansion of Topics and Subtopics

The ICSE Class 10 Mathematics syllabus for 2025-26 remains consistent with recent years, emphasizing conceptual understanding, calculations, and geometric precision in Mensuration, Statistics, and Constructions. Below is a comprehensive breakdown, drawn from authoritative educational sources aligned with CISCE guidelines.

#### Mensuration: Surface Areas and Volumes of Solids
Mensuration applies formulas to real-world scenarios, focusing exclusively on cylinder, cone, and sphere (including hemispheres where relevant). No frustum of cone or pyramid is included.

| Subtopic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Right Circular Cylinder | Total surface area = 2πr(h + r); Curved surface area = 2πrh; Volume = πr²h. Problems on open/closed cylinders, cost of material. |
| Right Circular Cone | Total surface area = πr(l + r); Curved surface area = πrl; Volume = (1/3)πr²h (l = slant height). |
| Sphere (and Hemisphere) | Surface area = 4πr² (sphere), 3πr² (hemisphere total); Volume = (4/3)πr³ (sphere), (2/3)πr³ (hemisphere). |
| Practical Applications | Cost problems (e.g., painting surface); Inner/outer volume (hollow objects); Melting/recasting (volume conservation); Combinations of two solids (e.g., hemisphere on cylinder). |

This unit tests formula application, unit conversions, and multi-step problem-solving.

#### Statistics: Measures of Central Tendency and Graphical Representation
Statistics introduces data interpretation through central tendencies and visuals, using both raw and grouped (continuous/discontinuous) data.

| Subtopic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Basic Concepts | Grouped vs. ungrouped data; Class intervals, frequency; Cumulative frequency. |
| Mean | For raw data; For grouped: Direct method, Assumed mean, Step-deviation. |
| Median | For raw (middle value); For grouped: Median class formula; From less-than ogive. |
| Mode | For raw; For grouped: Modal class, inspection, or from histogram peak. |
| Graphical Tools | Histograms (varying class widths) with frequency polygons; Less-than ogive; Derive mode (histogram), median/quartiles (ogive); Inter-quartile range (Q3 - Q1). |

Emphasis is on accuracy in calculations and interpreting graphs to find statistical measures.

#### Constructions: Geometric Constructions in Geometry
Constructions develop ruler-and-compass skills, integrated into Geometry (particularly Circles and Loci sections). Proofs are not required for loci theorems, but constructions must be precise.

| Subtopic | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Constructions Related to Circles | Draw tangents from external point (equal length property); Circumscribe circle on triangle (passes through vertices); Inscribe circle in triangle (tangents to sides); Inscribe/circumscribe on regular hexagon. |
| Constructions Based on Loci | Locus of point fixed distance from point (circle); Equidistant from two intersecting lines (angle bisector); Equidistant from two points (perpendicular bisector). Construct based on these theorems. |
| Supporting Concepts | Use tangent-radius perpendicularity; Alternate segment theorem for angles. |

These tasks reinforce circle theorems, similarity, and loci definitions.

The syllabus encourages practical understanding through applications, with no major changes reported for 2025-26 in these units. Students should practice diagrams for constructions and multi-step problems for mensuration/statistics.
